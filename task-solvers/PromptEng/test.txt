"The discussion is far from over. The true mind of science remains open to new data and alternative explanations. Whether and how much of the approximately 1/2 degree C of warming which occurred in the latter half of the 20th century is due to human industry has not been conclusively established. Neither have any of the incredibly expensive "solutions" proposed to address any global warming been shown to be meaningfully effective or worth their tremendous cost."	5_1

The EPAs Greenhouse Gas Inventory acknowledged this year that methane emissions from natural gas production have fallen 35% since 2007. Thats despite a 22% increase in gas production over the same period. The EPA last year found that methane emissions from hydraulically fractured gas wells had fallen 73% from 2011 to 2013. Overall methane emissions are 17% lower than in 1990.	0_0
"?Lukewarmers? are those scientists (and others) who believe the balance of evidence is middling between ?climate alarmists? (who tend to think that the global temperature rise will lie in, or even exceed, the upper half the IPCC?s 1.1 C?6.4 C range of projected temperature rise this century) and ultraskeptics, or ?flatliners?

"People concerned that manmade greenhouse gas emissions, in particular carbon dioxide (CO2), may be causing dangerous climate change worry such a change may disrupt the hydrosphere, which comprises all of the water on Earth and in its atmosphere. This disruption, they argue, would lead to increased rainfall and erratic weather patterns that would greatly increase sea level and produce potentially devastating consequences.A report from the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), an independent group of some 50 scientists from 15 countries, titled Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science, summarizes a large body of research disputing these claims and finds the hydrosphere has exhibited only mild volatility over the past century in concert with natural climate cycles and with no correlation to human CO2 emissions.The data show short-term precipitation volatility is not correlated with either CO2 emissions or general climate warming. For example, monsoon intensity displayed no increase later in the century despite increased CO2 emissions, but instead was correlated with solar activity.In addition, monsoons were generally more intensive during the Little Ice Age (LIA) than the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), which runs directly contrary to the alarmist claims. On the other end of the volatility spectrum, CCR-II disputes the strength of the commonly cited connection between global warming and droughts, as evidenced by the similar rates of drought occurrence in the LIA and MWP.As with precipitation, CCR-II finds no significant connection between sea level or ocean temperature and human CO2 emissions. Sea level is determined by a multitude of factors, and CO2-induced global warming is a minor one. Ocean temperatures have remained virtually unchanged for nine years, according to data of the Argo buoy network.CCR-II found numerous problems with the consensus view of sea-level change. The global sea level has increased by an average of only 12 mm annually over the century, with a wide range of intra-year volatility between +5mm and -5mm away from the mean. Supposed instances of environmental harm caused by sea-level rises, such as coral reef destruction, are often the result of unaccounted alternative factors.Concern over manmade greenhouse gas emissions has been the impetus for many destructive public policies, including renewable portfolio standards, alternative energy subsidies, and high gasoline taxes. Yet, despite ever-increasing levels of CO2 emissions, scientists have been unable to demonstrate a connection to its alleged effects, such as hydrosphere alteration, over the previous century. CCR-II's findings demonstrate precipitation and ocean activity have little to no connection to human CO2 emissions. Therefore, energy production, the lifeblood of the global economy, should not be hindered by state intervention to reduce CO2 emissions.The above introduction was based on text from Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science and its Summary for Policymakers, published by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC).The following documents provide additional information about the hydrosphere and oceans. Chapter 6 of Climate Change Reconsidered IIhttp://heartland.org/media-library/pdfs/CCR-II/Chapter-6-Hydrosphere-Oceans.pdfIn Chapter Six of Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science, Willem de Lange and Robert M. Carter find little evidence for an overall increase in global precipitation during the twentieth century independent of natural multidecadal climate rhythms. Summary for Policymakers of Climate Change Reconsidered IIhttp://heartland.org/media-library/pdfs/CCR-II/Summary-for-Policymakers.pdfThe IPCC claims to know, apparently with rising certainty over time, that "most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations" (IPCC AR4 SPM, p. 10). This Summary for Policymakers summarizes and interprets Climate Change Reconsidered II, a major scientific report that refutes this claim. More IPCC Misdirection: Its Dodgy Sea Level-Rise Assessmenthttp://www.cato.org/blog/more-ipcc-misdirection-its-dodgy-sea-level-rise-assessmentPatrick J. Michaels and Paul C. Knappenberger of the Cato Institute criticize the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's analysis of sea-level changes in a September 24, 2013 blog post. The authors point out the IPCC cherry-picks data clumps that coincide with their conclusions, while ignoring broader data that contradict them. For instance, the IPCC attributes the recent abnormally high increases in sea level to a new long-term trend, even though the rate of increase has already begun to decline to normal levels, thereby indicating this period was just another short-term cyclical increase. Precipitation Measurements and Trends in the Twentieth Century http://heartland.org/policy-documents/precipitation-measurements-and-trends-twentieth-centuryA research paper published in the International Journal of Climatology in 2002 presents the trends in precipitation over the last century. Global precipitation increased by only 9 mm per year over the century, despite enormous short-term volatility of up to 40mm. Short-term variability can be attributed to natural climate cycles, including reoccurring ENSOs, Arctic Oscillation, and Antarctic Oscillation. The authors admit global precipitation measurement is still primitive and not wholly reliable. Little Change in Global Drought Over the Past 60 Yearshttp://heartland.org/policy-documents/little-change-global-drought-over-past-60-yearsIn this paper published in 2012 in Nature, Justin Sheffield, Eric F. Wood, and Michael L. Roderick cast doubt on the supposed connection between global warming and the frequency of droughts over the past 60 years. The standard analysis used to estimate global moisture levels is highly flawed and underestimates moisture levels, they note. In reality, global moisture levels have barely changed, and by extension, theories that blame hydrosphere changes on global warming are also flawed. Research Explores Hidden Benefits of Intensive Rainfall in East Africahttp://phys.org/news/2012-11-explores-hidden-benefits-intensive-rainfall.htmlMaggie Clune looks at a new study published in 2012 in Nature Climate Change, which demonstrates some benefits of increased rainfall. Generally, climate scientists tend to focus on only the negative effects of climate change while ignoring the positive results it produces. One of these is that increased rainfall replenishes freshwater sources more often. This makes underwater aquifers, rivers, streams, etc. more bountiful, especially in technologically less-developed regions that are heavily dependent upon natural water sources, such as Central Africa. Indian Monsoon Variability in a Global Warming Scenariohttp://heartland.org/policy-documents/indian-monsoon-variability-global-warming-scenarioA paper published in 2003 in Natural Hazards applies to real historical data the IPCC's theory that global warming increases monsoon intensity. The researchers determined there is no correlation between monsoon intensity and global warming. Monsoon strength naturally oscillates along decade-long time intervals regardless of carbon production. Furthermore, increased global temperatures have no effect on intra-cycle variability.

"To the north, a recent earthquake along the Arctic Mid-Ocean Rift System released a 1,000-mile-long pulse of methane into the overlying ocean. Remote-sensing NASA satellites measured this gas release once it vertically escaped through the ocean into the atmosphere.

"The most impressive thing about this summer's vaunted droughtcalled an "ultra-drought" by CBS icon Dan Ratheris that it wasn't one. Whereas Rather called this a "summer to survive" in the Midwest, it actually looked more like a summer to grow.Illinois experienced what is at least its third-wettest June (records go back to 1895). Toward the end of June, the entire state of Illinois, 90 percent of Missouri and Wisconsin, and half of Iowa were reporting unusually moist conditions. We think that qualifies as the "Midwest."But why should we be surprised by this spate of climate hyperbole? That kind of drought hype is about as repetitive as Vice President Al Gore saying "risky." Last summer, for example, we were bombarded with the same story, even though less of the country than normal was experiencing a significant moisture shortage. Both the ostensible drought and forecasts of more of the same were based upon the appearance of La Nia (unusually cold) conditions in the tropical Pacific.Going back just another year, recall the agricultural disasters predicted because of El Nio, the warm phase of this common Pacific oscillation. One major network featured brown cornstalks and a cloud of dust in August. That was in Texas, where corn is normally brown in August, given that it's planted early in the year. As for the dust, it was kicked up by a harvester plucking fat ears.The beating goes on and on. And what we find most interesting is that people continue to eat. Well and cheaply, we might add. What gives?Let's stipulate that supply and demand determine price. For food, the latter is increasing because there is a larger number of demanding mouths to feed. Everything else being equal, the price of food should increase slightly as a result of that. But adding in the effect of the 2000 drought, the 1999 drought, the 1998 drought, and so forth should be as calamitous as the Network News.In an attempt to verify all these terrible stories, we plotted out the price of corn in dollars per bushel, allowing for inflation. What is immediately obvious is that the price of corn is lower than it has ever been. Despite all the weather gloom and doom, as well as the population increase, the relative supply of the most important crop produced by the most important agricultural nation in history must be increasing.Our greener pals keep blaming us for the fact that Americans just don't seem to care about global warming. But perhaps they ought to look in the mirror. Constantly hawking weather disasters has a way of losing its credibility in the face of agricultural abundance.It is absurd to conflate warming with food shortages. The corn yield history was virtually steady for the first half of the twentieth century, followed by a dramatic rise in the second half. Today, one acre of land produces almost four times as much corn as it did 100 years ago.During that same time, U.S. temperatures varied considerably from year to year and decade to decade. Obviously, there is little if any correspondence between the nation's temperatures and its crop yields.What warming the United States has seen in the last three decades has been primarily in winter and, within that season, largely confined to the coldest air massesa prediction from greenhouse theory that the climate Cassandras rarely tout. A temperature change of this sort is beneficial for crops because it lengthens their growing season.Another benefit for crop production is the ever-increasing atmospheric level of carbon dioxide. We can certainly assert with confidence that the presence of additional carbon dioxide is responsible for about 10 percent of this abundant harvest.The evidence is in. Today's climate is a boon to agricultureno matter what you may hear on the evening news.ReferencesMichaels, P.J., et al., 2000. Observed warming in cold anticyclones.

"The Kyoto Protocol, even if implementeUT Sf where evidence lies of an impact that only occurred some 12,800 years ago, barely time for a deep breath geologically, the Younger Dryas Impact proponents respond with an extremely weak mumbling about air blasts, asteroid clusters and ice sheet impacts that left no evidence of a large chunk(s) of space debris hitting the Earth. They point out that the Tunguska Impact (called an impact even though it left no crater) was an air-blast at an altitude of 3-6 miles (5-10 km) above Siberia that yielded the equivalent of 3-30 megatons of TNT in explosive force. The skeptics counter with Meteor Crater in Arizona, a beautiful little 1,200 ft (4,000 m) diameter hole 570 ft (170 m) deep made by a meteorite a mere 54 yds (50 m) in diameter that released 10 megatons of energy upon impact. They reasonably expect that a piece or pieces of space debris able to spread ejecta over half of the northern hemisphere, cause a 1,300 year halt in global warming and lead to the extinction of numerous species that had survived for hundreds of thousands of years had to leave some evidence of its arrival behind. The YD proponents then countered with the fact that the northern half of North America was covered with ice sheets and an impact on a 1 to 2 mile thick layer of ice may have mitigated the expected formation of a crater."	0_0
"UAH monitor temperatures from 60N to 85 by all industrialized countries, including the United States, would only barely slow the increase in GHG concentrations.Actually reducing GHG concentrations below todays levels (~385 ppm) may well exceed human capability in this century. Even outright de-industrialization of the United States might not be enough to lower GHG levels, since most emissions growth in the 21st century is projected to occur in developing countries ."	4_2
